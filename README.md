# Nayaka

Nayaka is a series of game poems that are also meditative exercises. The game introduces an interactive system that promotes an embodied understanding, an identification with the thing you are dancing with. It will avoid giving the player mastery over an element, but provide bodies that are willing to dance with the player. These bodies may be of the Western categories of 'animate' and 'inanimate', objects and environments, a bird and its flock - recognizing that things become one, separate and reform while always remaining part of the single texture of experience.
